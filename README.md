# ML_phylogeny_learning
 Thesis project on classifying different phylogeny models
 
 
1) The code for Generating and training is found on Rnotebooks
2) 001_All_trees_simulations.Rmd the trees and parameters of the trees are simulated
3) The other codes correspond to the training of each classifier
4) For the graph training  it is necessary to run the code in python c06_infer_gnn_graph.ipynb.
